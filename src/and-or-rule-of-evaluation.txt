and: to evaluate (and (pred) (pred)) in T+E:
1. Consider the first pred. Let p be the value of pred
2. if p is not a boolean, evaluation terminates with an error.
3. if p is false, evaluation terminates and return false;
4. if p is true, evaluate the second pred as q.
5. if q is not a boolean, evaluation terminates with an error.
6. if q is false, evaluation terminates and return false;
7. if q is true, return true.
